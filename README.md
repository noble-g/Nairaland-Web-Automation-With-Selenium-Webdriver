# Nairaland-Web-Automation-With-Selenium-Webdriver
About to write a code to automate actions of forums using nairaland.com as an example. 
Whether successful or not, in this program, I plan to learn selenium, webdriver,chrome driver, schedule, time and more while building the project. In sha Allah.
    The date is sept,24, 2021.
    
    

I abandoned and forgot about this web crawling project since sept, 24 2022 due to the selenium errors I couldn't get over. 
Now the date is dec 10, 2022 and I can confidently say that I cut through the errors I was facing last year like a hot blade through butter - Alhamdulillah for growth

Actually, the intent of getting on this project was to **automate NNU** - a forum that pays some insubstantial amount for every task the users accomplish, tasks like:

- [x] login
- [x] open thread
- [x] comment
- [x] like 
- [x] share 
- [x] follow OP

And now NNU is closed up, but my project lives on 😋😎😚😁.

- trading automation
